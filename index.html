    <h2><i>Interesting Facts about Origami </i></h2>
    <p>1.Origami is derived from two Japanese words: Ori (folded) and Kami (paper).
        2.Before that, the art was called “orikata” (folded shapes).
        3. An ancient Japanese legend says if you fold one thousand cranes you will be granted a wish
        4.Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture.
        5.In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin.
        6.Many studies assert that origami was invented by the Japanese about a thousand years ago, but its roots may well be in China.
        7.It is also highly probable that the process of folding was applied to other materials before paper was invented, so the origins of recreational folding may lie with cloth or leather.
